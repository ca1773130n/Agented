/**
 * `ag qa` — random-click QA over the running app, via mischief.

 *
 *   0  clean
 *   1  HIGH findings
 *   2  CRITICAL findings
 *   3  the harness failed, OR it could not prove it tested what it claimed
 *
 * 3 exists because the predecessor returned 1 for both "crashed" and "found real
 * bugs", so CI could not tell a broken runner from a broken app. A 3 means the
 * report is not evidence of anything — so it is passed through verbatim and
 * called out, never folded into "some failures".
